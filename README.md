CSC 543	Advanced Algorithms
This is an advanced course in current trends in Problem Solving and Algorithms that builds on our undergraduate courses data structure (CSC300) and CS Theory (CSC490). This course will look at emerging algorithms across the grand ideas of computer science. As new technologies emerge, new algorithms must be explored to support them.
